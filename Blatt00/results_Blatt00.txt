Our test could not be run on your code. This usually means there is something broken in your code.
To fix this issue please check the following points:

- Your code should never be in any package. Remove all lines "package XXX;" from your submission.
- You should not use any non-standard imports. Check the Beginning of your files for lines "import XXX" and remove them if they're not part of the Vorgabe.
- You should never use System.exit(0) or similar in your code.
- You should never change the function headers of the Vorgabe in your submission.
- You need to adhere to the given directory structure (see exercise sheet, e.g., BlattXX/src/ - check for spaces!)
- Your code should compile. If you see any red x in Eclipse or IDEA, please fix these problems before submitting.
- Do not use any german Umlaut characters in variable names or output strings (best not to use them anywhere)

For some of the algorithmic homeworks this error message might be caused by the inefficiency of your code. 
If your code needs way too much time or tries to use way too much space the test is cancelced and this error message appears. 
Check your termination conditions in recursions and loops (also in edge cases)! 
If you think, this migt be the case and you cannot fix it, it is best to go to the Rechneruebung.

If you checked all these points and there is still an issue, 
please make sure you filled out the ISIS Kursregistrierung and ask in the corresponding ISIS Forum OR contact us via Mail.
